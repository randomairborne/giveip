GiveIP is an IP address return server with no ads and no BS. \
You can also use cURL or wget giveip.io, it'll return a plaintext output as long as text/html is not in the Accept header. You can force this behavior by visiting [/raw](https://giveip.io/raw), which has permissive CORS and is free to use for all applications. To force a specific kind of IP, you can visit [v4.giveip.io/raw](https://v4.giveip.io/raw) or [v6.giveip.io/raw](https://v6.giveip.io/raw), which have DNS records for only IPv4 and IPv6 respectively.
